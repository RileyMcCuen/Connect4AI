# Connect4AI
Connect 4 minimax with alpha beta pruning. The Ai is instantiated with its number (either 1 or -1). 
The computer needs to be updated after every move including its own moves. The board that the Ai's heuristic 
looks at must be in the form of a 2D array of integers with the values -1, 0, 1.
